## Culture (by our CEO)
"I created Foton because after much professional experience on multinational companies such as General Electric or Siemens I wanted to work where all the developers would be a fundamental piece of the process, so I take our culture very seriously and care a lot about the developers happiness.

Besides shares and a good salary, I want to offer a great place to work with open source and side projects everywhere.

I also motivate everyone to talk on conferences/meetups and see it as an important path to become a better professional." -Jabur
