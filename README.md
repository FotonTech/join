## What we believe
> I founded Foton because, after much professional experience on multinational companies such as General Electric and Siemens, I wanted to work in a place where developers would feel at home. Therefore I take our culture very seriously and care a lot about developer satisfaction and happiness.

> Besides equity and a good salary, I want Foton to be a great place to work with open source and side projects. I also incentivize everybody to give talks on conferences and meetups because that's an important part of becoming a better professional."
