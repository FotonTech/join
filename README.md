# Join Foton
ðŸ’» Open positions on Foton Tech Company.

## About us
Foton is an ALL REMOTE tech company focused on mobile projects built with React Native, Apollo, Node, Mongo and GraphQL (JS IT ALL).

We work on challenging projects from Silicon Valley and we are also building Apps in da House.

We are looking for passionate developers who want to build the future with us.
We offer company shares, a competitive salary and an attractive culture.

## Our Culture
> I founded Foton because, after much professional experience on multinational companies such as General Electric and Siemens, I wanted to work in a place where developers would feel at home. Therefore I take our culture very seriously and care a lot about developer satisfaction and happiness.

> Besides equity and a good salary, I want Foton to be a great place to work with open source and side projects. I also incentivize everybody to give talks on conferences and meetups because that's an important part of becoming a better professional."

__Jabur - CEO__
